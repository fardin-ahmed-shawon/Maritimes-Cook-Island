        <li>If, at any time after an investigation is carried out to decide whether any action should be taken under section 26, the Secretary believes that any relevant maritime document or the recognition of a document as a maritime document should be revoked, the Secretary may revoke that document or the recognition of that document.</li>
        <li>Where the Secretary proposes to revoke a maritime document or the recognition of a document as a maritime document, the Secretary shall give notice in accordance with section 34, which shall apply as if the proposed revocation were a proposed adverse decision under this Act.</li>

        <li>Goods includes goods, wares, merchandise, and articles of every kind whatsoever except live animals and cargo which by the contract of carriage is stated as being carried on deck and is so carried.</li>
        <li>Vessel means any vessel used for the carriage of goods by sea.</li>
        <li>Carriage of goods covers the period from the time when the goods are loaded on to the time they are discharged from the vessel.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4 id="article2">Article 2</h4>
    <p>Subject to the provisions of Article 6, under every contract of carriage of goods by sea the carrier, in relation to the loading, handling, stowage, carriage, custody, care and discharge of such goods, shall be subject to the responsibilities and liabilities, and entitled to the rights and immunities hereinafter set forth.</p>

    <h4 id="article3">Article 3</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>The carrier shall be bound before and at the beginning of the voyage to exercise due diligence to -
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Make the vessel seaworthy.</li>
                <li>Properly man, equip and supply the vessel.</li>
                <li>Make the holds, refrigerating and cool chambers, and all other parts of the vessel in which goods are carried, fit and safe for their reception, carriage and preservation.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Subject to the provisions of Article 4, the carrier shall properly and carefully load, handle, stow, carry, keep, care for, and discharge the goods carried.</li>
        <li>After receiving the goods into his charge the carrier or the master or agent of the carrier shall, on demand of the shipper, issue to the shipper a bill of lading showing among other things -
            <ol type="a">
                <li>The leading marks necessary for identification of the goods as the same are furnished in writing by the shipper before the loading of such goods starts, provided such marks are stamped or otherwise shown clearly upon the goods if uncovered, or on the cases or coverings in which such goods are contained, in such a manner as should ordinarily remain legible until the end of the voyage.</li>
                <li>Either the number of packages or pieces, or the quantity, or weight, as the case may be, as furnished in writing by the shipper.</li>
                <li>The apparent order and condition of the goods.</li>

            <p>Provided that no carrier, master or agent of the carrier shall be bound to state or show in the bill of lading any marks, number, quantity, or weight which he has reasonable ground for suspecting not accurately to represent the goods actually received, or which he has had no reasonable means of checking.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Such a bill of lading shall be prima facie evidence of the receipt by the carrier of the goods as therein described in accordance with paragraph 3(a), (b) and (c). However, proof to the contrary shall not be admissible when the bill of lading has been transferred to a third party acting in good faith.</li>
        <li>The shipper shall be deemed to have guaranteed to the carrier the accuracy at the time of shipment of the marks, number, quantity and weight, as furnished by him, and the shipper shall indemnify the carrier against all loss, damages and expenses arising or resulting from inaccuracies in such particulars. The right of the carrier to such indemnity shall in no way limit his responsibility and liability under the contract of carriage to any person other than the shipper.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 id="article4">Article 4</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Neither the carrier nor the vessel shall be liable for loss or damage arising or resulting from unseaworthiness unless caused by want of due diligence on the part of the carrier to make the vessel seaworthy, and to secure that the vessel is properly manned, equipped and supplied, and to make the holds, refrigerating and cool chambers and all other parts of the vessel in which goods are carried fit and safe for their reception, carriage and preservation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 3. Whenever loss or damage has resulted from unseaworthiness the burden of proving the exercise of due diligence shall be on the carrier or other person claiming exemption under this article.</li>

            <ol type="a">

                <li>Quarantine restrictions.</li>
                <li>Act or omission of the shipper or owner of the goods, his agent or representative.</li>

                <li>Latent defects not discoverable by due diligence.</li>
                <li>Any other cause arising without the actual fault or privity of the carrier, or without the actual fault or neglect of the agents or servants of the carrier, but the burden of proof shall be on the person claiming the benefit of this exception to show that neither the actual fault or privity of the carrier nor the fault or neglect of the agents or servants of the carrier contributed to the loss or damage.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The shipper shall not be responsible for loss or damage sustained by the carrier or the vessel arising or resulting from any cause without the act, fault or neglect of the shipper, his agents or his servants.</li>
        <li>Any deviation in saving or attempting to save life or property at sea or any reasonable deviation shall not be deemed to be an infringement or breach of this convention or of the contract of carriage, and the carrier shall not be liable for any loss or damage resulting therefrom.</li>
        <li>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Unless the nature and value of such goods have been declared by the shipper before shipment and inserted in the bill of lading, neither the carrier nor the vessel shall in any event be or become liable for any loss or damage to or in connection with the goods in an amount exceeding 666.67 units of account per package or unit or 2 units of account per kilogramme of gross weight of the goods lost or damaged, whichever is the higher.</li>
                <li>The total amount recoverable shall be calculated by reference to the value of such goods at the place and time at which the goods are discharged from the vessel in accordance with the contract or should have been so discharged.
                    The value of the goods shall be fixed according to the commodity exchange price, or, if there be no such price, according to the current market price, or, if there be no commodity exchange price or current market price, by reference to the normal value of goods of the same kind and quality.</li>
                <li>Where a container, pallet or similar article of transport is used to consolidate goods, the number of packages or units enumerated in the Bill of Lading as packed in such article of transport shall be deemed the number of packages or units for the purpose of this paragraph as far as these packages or units are concerned. Except as aforesaid such article of transport shall be considered the package or unit.</li>
                <li>The unit of account mentioned in this Article is the Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund. The amounts mentioned in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph shall be converted into national currency on the basis of the value of that currency on a date to be determined by the law of the court seized of the case.</li>

        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4 id="article4b">Article 4b</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>The defences and limits of liability provided for in this Convention shall apply in any action against the carrier in respect of loss or damage to goods covered by a contract of carriage whether the action be founded in contract or in tort.</li>
        <li>If such an action is brought against a servant or agent of the carrier (such servant or agent not being an independent contractor), such servant or agent shall be entitled to avail himself of the defences and limits of liability which the carrier is entitled to invoke under this Convention.</li>
        <li>The aggregate of the amounts recoverable from the carrier, and such servants and agents, shall in no case exceed the limit provided for in this Convention.</li>
        <li>Nevertheless, a servant or agent of the carrier shall not be entitled to avail himself of the provisions of this Article, if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the servant or agent done with intent to cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 id="article5">Article 5</h4>
    <p>A carrier shall be at liberty to surrender in whole or in part all or any of his rights and immunities or to increase any of his responsibilities and obligations under this convention, provided such surrender or increase shall be embodied in the Bill of Lading issued to the shipper. The provisions of this convention shall not be applicable to charter parties, but if bills of lading are issued in the case of a vessel under a charter party they shall comply with the terms of this convention. Nothing in these rules shall be held to prevent the insertion in a Bill of Lading of any lawful provision regarding general average.</p>

    <h4 id="article6">Article 6</h4>
    <p>Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding articles, a carrier, master or agent of the carrier and a shipper shall in regard to any particular goods be at liberty to enter into any agreement in any terms as to the responsibility and liability of the carrier for such goods, and as to the rights and immunities of the carrier in respect of such goods, or his obligation as to seaworthiness, so far as this stipulation is not contrary to public policy, or the care or diligence of his servants or agents in regard to the loading, handling, stowage, carriage, custody, care and discharge of the goods carried by sea, provided that in this case no bill of lading has been or shall be issued and that the terms agreed shall be embodied in a receipt which shall be a non-negotiable document and shall be marked as such.</p>
    <p>Any agreement so entered into shall have full legal effect.</p>
    <p>Provided that this article shall not apply to ordinary commercial shipments made in the ordinary course of trade, but only to other shipments where the character or condition of the property to be carried or the circumstances, terms and conditions under which the carriage is to be performed are such as reasonably to justify a special agreement.</p>

    <h4 id="article7">Article 7</h4>
    <p>Nothing herein contained shall prevent a carrier or a shipper from entering into any agreement, stipulation, condition, reservation or exemption as to the responsibility and liability of the carrier or the vessel for the loss or damage to, or in connection with, the custody and care and handling of goods prior to the loading on, and subsequent to the discharge from the vessel on which the goods are carried by sea.</p>

    <p>THE STATES PARTIES TO THE PRESENT CONVENTION, RECOGNIZING the desirability of determining by agreement uniform international rules regarding salvage operations,</p>
    <p>NOTING that substantial developments, in particular the increased concern for the protection of the environment, have demonstrated the need to review the international rules presently contained in the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law relating to Assistance and Salvage at Sea, done at Brussels, 23 September 1910,</p>
    <p>CONSCIOUS of the major contribution which efficient and timely salvage operations can make to the safety of vessels and other property in danger and to the protection of the environment,</p>
    <p>CONVINCED of the need to ensure that adequate incentives are available to persons who undertake salvage operations in respect of vessels and other property in danger,</p>
    <p>HAVE AGREED as follows:</p>

    <h4 id="article4s6">Article 4 - State-owned vessels</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Without prejudice to article 5, this Convention shall not apply to warships or other non-commercial vessels owned or operated by a State and entitled, at the time of salvage operations, to sovereign immunity under generally recognized principles of international law unless that State decides otherwise.</li>
        <li>Where a State Party decides to apply the Convention to its warships or other vessels described in paragraph 1, it shall notify the Secretary-General thereof specifying the terms and conditions of such application.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4 id="article5s6">Article 5 - Salvage operations controlled by public authorities</h4>

    <h4 id="article8s6">Article 8 - Duties of the salvor and of the owner and master</h4>
    <ol>

                <li>to carry out the salvage operations with due care;</li>

                <li>whenever circumstances reasonably require, to seek assistance from other salvors; and</li>
                <li>to accept the intervention of other salvors when reasonably requested to do so by the owner or master of the vessel or other property in danger; provided however that the amount of his reward shall not be prejudiced should it be found that such a request was unreasonable.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The owner and master of the vessel or the owner of other property in danger shall owe a duty to the salvor:
            <ol type="a">
                <li>to co-operate fully with him during the course of the salvage operations;</li>
                <li>in so doing, to exercise due care to prevent or minimize damage to the environment; and</li>
                <li>when the vessel or other property has been brought to a place of safety, to accept re-delivery when reasonably requested by the salvor to do so.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4 id="article9s6">Article 9 - Rights of coastal States</h4>
    <p>Nothing in this Convention shall affect the right of the coastal State concerned to take measures in accordance with generally recognized principles of international law to protect its coastline or related interests from pollution or the threat of pollution following upon a maritime casualty or acts relating to such a casualty which may reasonably be expected to result in major harmful consequences, including the right of a coastal State to give directions in relation to salvage operations.</p>
    <h4 id="article10s6">Article 10 - Duty to render assistance</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Every master is bound, so far as he can do so without serious danger to his vessel and persons thereon, to render assistance to any person in danger of being lost at sea.</li>
        <li>The States Parties shall adopt the measures necessary to enforce the duty set out in paragraph 1.</li>
        <li>The owner of the vessel shall incur no liability for a breach of the duty of the master under paragraph 1.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4 id="article11s6">Article 11 - Co-operation</h4>

    <h3>Chapter III - Rights of Salvors</h3>

    <h4 id="article12s6">Article 12 - Conditions for reward</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Salvage operations which have had a useful result give right to a reward.</li>
        <li>Except as otherwise provided, no payment is due under this Convention if the salvage operations have had no useful result.</li>
        <li>This chapter shall apply, notwithstanding that the salved vessel and the vessel undertaking the salvage operations belong to the same owner.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4 id="article13s6">Article 13 - Criteria for fixing the reward</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>The reward shall be fixed with a view to encouraging salvage operations, taking into account the following criteria without regard to the order in which they are presented below:
            <ol type="a">
                <li>the salved value of the vessel and other property;</li>
                <li>the skill and efforts of the salvors in preventing or minimizing damage to the environment;</li>
                <li>the measure of success obtained by the salvor;</li>
                <li>the nature and degree of the danger;</li>
                <li>the skill and efforts of the salvors in salving the vessel, other property and life;</li>
                <li>the time used and expenses and losses incurred by the salvors;</li>
                <li>the risk of liability and other risks run by the salvors or their equipment;</li>
                <li>the promptness of the services rendered;</li>
                <li>the availability and use of vessels or other equipment intended for salvage operations;</li>
                <li>the state of readiness and efficiency of the salvor's equipment and the value thereof.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Payment of a reward fixed according to paragraph 1 shall be made by all of the vessel and other property interests in proportion to their respective salved values. However, a State Party may in its national law provide that the payment of a reward has to be made by one of these interests, subject to a right of recourse of this interest against the other interests for their respective shares. Nothing in this article shall prevent any right of defence.</li>
        <li>The rewards, exclusive of any interest and recoverable legal costs that may be payable thereon, shall not exceed the salved value of the vessel and other property.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4 id="article14s6">Article 14 - Special compensation</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>If the salvor has carried out salvage operations in respect of a vessel which by itself or its cargo threatened damage to the environment and has failed to earn a reward under article 13 at least equivalent to the special compensation assessable in accordance with this article, he shall be entitled to special compensation from the owner of that vessel equivalent to his expenses as herein defined.</li>
        <li>If, in the circumstances set out in paragraph 1, the salvor by his salvage operations has prevented or minimized damage to the environment, the special compensation payable by the owner to the salvor under paragraph 1 may be increased up to a maximum of 30% of the expenses incurred by the salvor. However, the tribunal, if it deems it fair and just to do so and bearing in mind the relevant criteria set out in article 13, paragraph 1, may increase such special compensation further, but in no event shall the total increase be more than 100% of the expenses incurred by the salvor.</li>
        <li>Salvor's expenses for the purpose of paragraphs 1 and 2 means the out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by the salvor in the salvage operation and a fair rate for equipment and personnel actually and reasonably used in the salvage operation, taking into consideration the criteria set out in article 13, paragraph 1(h), (i) and (j).</li>
        <li>The total special compensation under this article shall be paid only if and to the extent that such compensation is greater than any reward recoverable by the salvor under article 13.</li>
        <li>If the salvor has been negligent and has thereby failed to prevent or minimize damage to the environment, he may be deprived of the whole or part of any special compensation due under this article.</li>
        <li>Nothing in this article shall affect any right of recourse on the part of the owner of the vessel.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 id="article15s6">Article 15 - Apportionment between salvors</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>The apportionment of a reward under article 13 between salvors shall be made on the basis of the criteria contained in that article.</li>
        <li>The apportionment between the owner, master and other persons in the service of each salving vessel shall be determined by the law of the flag of that vessel. If the salvage has not been carried out from a vessel, the apportionment shall be determined by the law governing the contract between the salvor and his servants.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4 id="article16s6">Article 16 - Salvage of persons</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>No remuneration is due from persons whose lives are saved, but nothing in this article shall affect the provisions of national law on this subject.</li>
        <li>A salvor of human life, who has taken part in the services rendered on the occasion of the accident giving rise to salvage, is entitled to a fair share of the payment awarded to the salvor for salving the vessel or other property or preventing or minimizing damage to the environment.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4 id="article17s6">Article 17 - Services rendered under existing contracts</h4>
    <p>No payment is due under the provisions of this Convention unless the services rendered exceed what can be reasonably considered as due performance of a contract entered into before the danger arose.</p>

    <h4 id="article18s6">Article 18 - The effect of salvor's misconduct</h4>
    <p>A salvor may be deprived of the whole or part of the payment due under this Convention to the extent that salvage operations have become necessary or more difficult because of fault or neglect on his part or if the salvor has been guilty of fraud or other dishonest conduct.</p>

    <h4 id="article19s6">Article 19 - Prohibition of salvage operations</h4>
    <p>Services rendered notwithstanding the express and reasonable prohibition of the owner or master of the vessel or the owner of any other property in danger which is not and has not been on board the vessel shall not give rise to payment under this Convention.</p>

    <h3>Chapter IV - Claims and Actions</h3>

    <h4 id="article20s6">Article 20 - Maritime lien</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Nothing in this Convention shall affect the salvor's maritime lien under any international convention or national law.</li>

    </ol>

    <h4 id="article21s6">Article 21 - Duty to provide security</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Upon the request of the salvor a person liable for payment due under this Convention shall provide satisfactory security for the claim, including interest and costs of the salvor.</li>
        <li>Without prejudice to paragraph 1, the owner of the salved vessel shall use his best endeavours to ensure that the owners of the cargo provide satisfactory security for the claims against them including interest and costs before the cargo is released.</li>
        <li>The salved vessel and other property shall not, without the consent of the salvor, be removed from the port or place at which they first arrive after the completion of the salvage operations until satisfactory security has been put up for the salvor's claim against the relevant vessel or property.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4 id="article22s6">Article 22 - Interim payment</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>The tribunal having jurisdiction over the claim of the salvor may, by interim decision, order that the salvor shall be paid on account such amount as seems fair and just, and on such terms including terms as to security where appropriate, as may be fair and just according to the circumstances of the case.</li>
        <li>In the event of an interim payment under this article the security provided under article 21 shall be reduced accordingly.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 id="article23s6">Article 23 - Limitation of actions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Any action relating to payment under this Convention shall be time-barred if judicial or arbitral proceedings have not been instituted within a period of two years. The limitation period commences on the day on which the salvage operations are terminated.</li>
        <li>The person against whom a claim is made may at any time during the running of the limitation period extend that period by a declaration to the claimant. This period may in the like manner be further extended.</li>
        <li>An action for indemnity by a person liable may be instituted even after the expiration of the limitation period provided for in the preceding paragraphs, if brought within the time allowed by the law of the State where proceedings are instituted.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4 id="article24s6">Article 24 - Interest</h4>
    <p>The right of the salvor to interest on any payment due under this Convention shall be determined according to the law of the State in which the tribunal seized of the case is situated.</p>

    <h4 id="article25s6">Article 25 - State-owned cargoes</h4>
    <p>Unless the State owner consents, no provision of this Convention shall be used as a basis for the seizure, arrest or detention by any legal process of, nor for any proceedings in rem against, non-commercial cargoes owned by a State and entitled, at the time of the salvage operations, to sovereign immunity under generally recognised principles of international law.</p>

    <h4 id="article26s6">Article 26 - Humanitarian cargoes</h4>
    <p>No provision of this Convention shall be used as a basis for the seizure, arrest or detention of humanitarian cargoes donated by a State, if such State has agreed to pay for salvage services rendered in respect of such humanitarian cargoes.</p>

    <p>States Parties shall encourage, as far as possible and with the consent of the parties, the publication of arbitral awards made in salvage cases.</p>
