                <li>employees or agents of the owner or members of the crew;</li>
                <li>the pilot or any other person who, without being a member of the crew, performs services for the ship;</li>
                <li>any charterer (howsoever described, including a bareboat charterer), manager or operator of the ship;</li>
                <li>any person performing salvage operations with the consent of the owner or on the instructions of a competent public authority;</li>
                <li>any person taking preventive measures;</li>
                <li>all employees or agents of persons mentioned in sub-paragraphs (c), (d) and (e),</li>
            </ol>
            unless the damage resulted from their personal act or omission, committed with the intent to cause such damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that such damage would probably result.
        </li>
        <li>Nothing in this Part of this Act shall prejudice any right of recourse of the owner against third parties.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="section24">24. Limitation of Liability</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The owner of a vessel shall be entitled to limit his liability under this Part of this Act in respect of any one incident to an aggregate amount calculated as follows:
            <ol type="a">
                <li>3 million units of account for a ship not exceeding 5,000 units of tonnage;</li>
                <li>for a ship with a tonnage in excess thereof, for each additional unit of tonnage, 420 units of account in addition to the amount mentioned in sub-paragraph (a),</li>
            </ol>
            Provided, however, that this aggregate amount shall not in any event exceed 59.7 million units of account.
        </li>
        <li>The owner shall not be entitled to limit his liability under this Part of this Act if it is proved that the pollution damage resulted from his personal act or omission, committed with the intent to cause such damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that such damage would probably result.</li>
        <li>For the purpose of availing himself of the benefit of the limitation provided for in sub-section (1), the owner shall constitute a fund for the total sum representing the limit of his liability with the Court or other competent authority of any one of the Contracting States in which action is brought under Article IX of CLC 1969 or, if no action is brought, with any Court in which an action is brought under Article IX of CLC 1969. The fund can be constituted either by depositing the sum or by producing a bank guarantee or other guarantee in an amount considered adequate by the Court.</li>
        <li>The fund shall be distributed among the claimants in proportion to the amounts of their established claims.</li>
        <li>If before the fund is distributed the owner or any of his employees or agents or any person providing him insurance or other financial security has as a result of the incident in question, paid compensation for pollution damage, such person shall, up to the amount he has paid, acquire by subrogation the rights which the person so compensated would have enjoyed under this Part of this Act.</li>
        <li>The right of subrogation provided for in sub-section (5) may also be exercised by a person other than those mentioned therein in respect of any amount of compensation for pollution damage that he may have paid.</li>
        <li>Where the owner or any other person establishes that he may be compelled to pay at a later date in whole or in part any such amount of compensation, with regard to which such person would have enjoyed a right of subrogation under sub-sections (5) or (6), had the compensation been paid before the fund was distributed, the Court may order that a sufficient sum shall be provisionally set aside to enable such person at such later date to enforce his claim against the fund.</li>
        <li>Claims in respect of expenses reasonably incurred or sacrifices reasonably made by the owner voluntarily to prevent or minimise pollution damage shall rank equally with other claims against the fund.</li>
        <li>The "unit of account" referred to in sub-section (1) is the Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund. The amounts mentioned in sub-section (1) shall be converted into New Zealand currency on the basis of the value of that currency by reference to the Special Drawing Right on the date of the constitution of the fund referred to in sub-section (3).</li>
        <li>The value of the New Zealand currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, shall be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied by the International Monetary Fund in effect on the date in question for its operations and transactions.</li>
        <li>For the purpose of this section, the vessel tonnage shall be the gross tonnage calculated in accordance with the tonnage measurement regulations contained in Annex 1 of the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969.</li>
        <li>The insurer or other person providing financial security shall be entitled to constitute a fund in accordance with this section on the same conditions and having the same effect as if it were constituted by the owner. Such a fund may be constituted even if, under the provisions of sub-section (2) of this section, the owner is not entitled to limit his liability, but its constitution shall in that case not prejudice the rights of any claimant against the owner.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="section25">25. Rights of Owner on Constitution of Fund</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Where the owner, after an incident, has constituted a fund in accordance with section 24 and is entitled to limit his liability,
            <ol type="a">
                <li>no person having a claim for pollution damage arising out of that incident shall be entitled to exercise any right against any other assets of the owner in respect of such claim;</li>
                <li>the Court shall order the release of any vessel or other property belonging to the owner which has been arrested in respect of a claim for pollution damage arising out of that incident, and shall similarly release any bail or other security furnished to avoid such arrest.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The foregoing, however, shall only apply if the claimant has access to the Court administering the fund and the fund is actually available in respect of his claim.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="section26">26. Requirement for Insurance</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The owner of a vessel registered in a signatory State and carrying more than 2,000 tonnes of oil in bulk as cargo shall be required to maintain insurance or other financial security, such as the guarantee of a bank or a certificate delivered by an international compensation fund, in the sums fixed by applying the limits of liability prescribed in section 24 sub-section (1) to cover his liability for pollution damage under CLC 1969.</li>
        <li>The owner of a vessel referred to in sub-section (1) of this section shall be required to keep a certificate of insurance aboard the vessel in a form set forth in Regulations.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="section27">27. Right of Compensation Extinguished</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rights of compensation under this Part of this Act shall be extinguished unless an action is brought within three years from the date when the damage occurred. However, in no case shall an action be brought after six years from the date of the incident that caused the damage.</li>
        <li>Where this incident consists of a series of occurrences, the six years period shall run from the date of the first such occurrence.</li>

                <li>when any such signatory States within ninety (90) days' notice of any such action shall be given to the defendant.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>After the fund has been constituted in accordance with section 24 of this Act, the Court in which the fund is constituted shall be exclusively competent to determine all matters relating to the apportionment and distribution of the fund.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="section29">29. Judgements Enforceable</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Any judgement given by a Court with jurisdiction in accordance with section 28 of this Act that is enforceable in the State of origin when all avenues of appeal have been exhausted shall be recognised in any signatory State.</li>
        <li>A judgement recognised under sub-section (1) shall be enforceable in each signatory State as soon as the formalities required in that State have been complied with. These formalities shall not permit the merits of the case to be re-opened.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="section30">30. Exemptions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The provisions of this Part of this Act shall not apply to warships or other ships owned or operated by a State and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service.</li>

            </ol>
